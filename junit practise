create an application of banking where we have a method which can calculate the emi and one more method which will calculate the complex interest rate for the banking , 
The complex rate has two parameters which are rate with a specified period of interest accrual and the capital growth coefficient.
and then create 2 or more than 2 test cases using junit for testing your application

1. Scenario:
Test a banking application. This application handles
complex financial calculations(emi calculator). Your task is
to create a comprehensive JUnit test cases.

Example 1 - Inputs:

1. Mocked external services to use it without any real time service
2. Mocke the repository throught mockito so that real repository wont be called again and again.

Example 1 - Outputs:
1. JUnit test cases.
2. Detailed test execution logs highlighting test successes and failures.

currency api call that api using mockito

2. Scenario:
You are tasked with testing a complex, highly interactive e-commerce website that relies on dynamic elements.

Example 1 - Inputs:
1. Complex web pages with dynamic content.
2. Integrate with Selenium scripts, Run from TestNG,update Testng report , Report Results and Anlyze

Example 1 - Outputs:
1. A TestNG suite with comprehensive test cases covering user interactions.
2. Screenshot comparisons to detect the reports validity
